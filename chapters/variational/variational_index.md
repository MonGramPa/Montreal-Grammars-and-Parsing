Introduction
============

The Model
---------

The model we are working with is the Adaptor Grammar model, first
introduced in @Johnson2007. Specifically, we’ll be giving some
background and fleshing out the derivations for the variational Adaptor
Grammar presented in @Cohesssn2010. If you haven’t already, read these two
papers before going further.

First, we'll introduce variational methodology and cover the [derivation of a variational lower bound](lower_bound.html) for this model. Then, we will see the [derivations of variational distributions](deriving_q.html) for some of the latent variables in the model.
