<h2 id="the-model">The Model</h2>

<p>The model we are working with is the Adaptor Grammar model, first
introduced in @Johnson2007. Specifically, we’ll be giving some
background and fleshing out the derivations for the variational Adaptor
Grammar presented in @Cohesssn2010. If you haven’t already, read these two
papers before going further.</p>

<p>First, we’ll introduce variational methodology and cover the <a href="lower_bound.html">derivation of a variational lower bound</a> for this model. Then, we will see the <a href="deriving_q.html">derivations of variational distributions</a> for some of the latent variables in the model.</p>
